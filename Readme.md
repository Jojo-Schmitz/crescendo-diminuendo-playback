Plugin for MuseScore 1.1+ to set velocity values for crescendos and diminuendos.
-----

To use, you must set the velocity value of the first and last notes,
either manually by right clicking on the note and going to properties,
or the preferred way, but simply using one of the dynamic markings
such as Pianissimo, Forte, Mezzoforte, etc.

Select the notes from FIRST to LAST, then just click on the plugin and
it will automatically set the velocity values. The only velocity values
that are important are the first and last, the ones in between will
automatically be changed regardless of current value.

It can go either way, set the first note louder, and the last note more quiet,
or vice versa, and it will automatically increment the velocities up or down
accordingly.
